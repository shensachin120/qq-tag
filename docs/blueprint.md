## Core Features:

- QR Sticker Generation: Generates pre-printed, durable stickers with unique QR codes linking to qqtag.com URLs. Includes 'Scan to Return' text below each QR code.
- Batch QR Management: Provides admin interface for batch QR code generation where admin can enter the number of QR codes to generate. Displays batch details (batch name, start ID, end ID) post-generation.
- Multi-Size QR Printing: Allows admins to print QR codes in multiple sizes (small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large) either in batches or individually, outputting downloadable PDFs.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid blue (#29ABE2) to convey trust and reliability, given the nature of connecting finders with the lost item owners.

- Accent color: A complementary yellow (#FFDA63) for call-to-action buttons and highlights, adding a touch of optimism and friendliness to the overall feel.
- Clean, modern sans-serif font for readability and a professional look.
- Simple, intuitive icons to represent various actions and information within the app.
- Responsive design ensuring a seamless experience across all devices (desktops, tablets, and smartphones).
- Subtle animations for user feedback and engagement (e.g., QR code scanning success, form submission).
